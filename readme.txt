   FILE STRUCTURE:
        - readme.txt          -> this file
        - testSequenceSet.cpp -> This is a test driver to show the functionality of the SequenceSet
        - main.cpp            -> Can be renamed. This is the main program to handle the data.
        - SequenceSet.h       -> This is the header file to contain the class used in both files.
        - Files
            - us_postal_codes_formated.txt         -> data formated cleanly
            - us_postal_codes_column_reorder.txt   -> data in differnt order by column
            - us_postal_codes_row_randomized.txt   -> data in different order by randomized row
            - us_postal_codes.xlsx                 -> excel file with the data




    
   WHAT TO SUBMIT:
    - A Design Document for the Sequence Set class and for the test driver program.
    - A Test Document for the Sequence Set class,
          Describe each test along with an explanation of why you chose it,
          and what was the result of each test.
          This should include a script file from the test runs.
          Each test should be annotated on the script file.
    - A User Manual.
          This should describe:
              - The name of the class.
              - Describe how to use the public methods.
              - How to compile the class. (use a makefile)
              - Examples of using the methods.
              - How to use the test driver program.
              - Note the known errors and deficiencies for the class? 

    - Source files
      Include:
          a Doxygen PDF to display the Sequence Set Class (and subordinate classes), its source code, and its UML class diagrams
          the .cpp files for the Sequence Set Class, the test driver program
          the application program.
          the script file that was generated to show the running of the application program.
          the class' makefile if you used one to compile the class.
          (zip the source files: {see https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14200/windows-compress-uncompress-zip-files})
